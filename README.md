BlueHorizon Website, forces login functionality to ensure information privacy. Currently uses XAMPP to hose apache server and MySQL database, these can be integrated onto a rapberrypi and then ran locally to access on a local network. The functionality cannot be seen through GitHub pages as they dont have an sql database. This can be integrated to a public website and visited anywhere in world if a static ip is assigned to host computer of the server and then port forwading is enabled to map a path from your routers public ip to the local ip of the server.
